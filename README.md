# Enum-State-Machine
 
**Part 1** 
Download or clone the repository below and add to Unity. Fix the walking state so the player slows down or stops when the arrow up key is released.
When the player comes to a stop, change its state to idle.  

**Part 2** 
Add a deadly obstacle to the scene and change the player's state to 'dead' when it collides with the obstacle. It should then return to the 'idle' state after a short period of time.


**What to hand in** 
Attach your completed player.cs script showing the new state and the fixed walk state.

Make a recording of the solution.
